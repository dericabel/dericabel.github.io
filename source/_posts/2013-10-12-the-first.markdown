# The First

So I have started writing code with EmberJS over the past month and felt it would be good to give back to the community.  I figure a blog would be a great place to write about my experiences and trials with JavaScript and EmberJS.
First off, I am a very new web developer, I have only been writing javascript for the past 3 years and fulltime only in the past 2 months.  So I will have mistakes and errors in my thinking but I welcome all constructive critism.  I think we can all learn from each other.
